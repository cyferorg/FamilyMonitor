<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Friends Monitor is a very simple app in that it works with Google Maps. Most of the configuration that Friends Monitor uses is set through the Google Maps interface either via the Maps browser interface or the Maps app. Ask your friends and family to allow Google Maps to share their location with you (see below).Use Google Maps to define locations that will be used by Friends Monitor, for example your home location.</p>
<p>Within Friends Monitor define the alarms you require which are in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suwon is further than 800m from home.
<li>James is closer than 2km from the library.
<li>Suwon is further than 500m from Me.
<li>Me is closer than 20km from the office.
</ul>
<p>Note that you refer to yourself as Me. And that's it!</p>

<ul>
<li>Check frequency
<p>How frequently to request an update of your friends' locations from Google. A value lower than every two minutes is not possible.</p>

<ol>
<li> Alarm fires when James is closer than 100m from home
<li> Later James becomes further than 100m from home
<li> Later still James is closer than 100m from home, if the alarm auto resets, the alarm will fire again. If the alarm does not auto reset then no new alarm will fire.
</ol>
<li>Alarm Reset Period
<p>How long to wait before resetting the alarm. In the above example, this the Alarm Reset Period is, at step 2, how long James has to be further than 100m from home before the alarm auto resets.</p>
<li>Units of Distance
<p>Whether the metric or imperial system should be used .</p>
